# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

## Description
This is currently WIP!
This repository contains all source code that I have produced while working through the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) of Andrew Ng on Coursera.

|`neural-networks-and-deep-learning`| This folder contains the source code for the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course. This includes jupyter notebooks for numpy basics, for building a logistic regression model as NN, for building a 3-layer NN with numpy to classify different generated datasets and for building a multilayer NN to classify images into cat and non-cat images.
