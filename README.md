# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

## Description
This is currently WIP!
This repository contains all source code that I have produced while working through the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) of Andrew Ng on Coursera.

## Contents

| File / folder                         | Description 
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------
|`neural-networks-and-deep-learning`| This folder contains the source code as well as notes for the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course. This includes jupyter notebooks for numpy basics, for building a logistic regression model as NN, for building a 3-layer NN with numpy to classify different generated datasets and for building a multilayer NN to classify images into cat and non-cat images.
|`improving-dnns-with-hyperparameter-tuning-regularization-and-optimization`| This folder contains the source code as well as notes for the "Improving DNNs with Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization" course. This includes jupyter notebooks for gradient checking, for comparison of different optimizers and for a tensorflow tutorial.
|`structuring-machine-learning-projects`| This folder contains the notes for the "Structuring Machine Learning Projects" course. There were no coding exercises in this course.
|`convolutional-neural-networks`| This folder contains the source code as well as notes for the "Convolutional Neural Networks" course. This includes juypter notebooks for building a convnet in numpy, for building a convnet with tensorflow, for a keras tutorial and for face recognition.
|`sequence-models`| This folder contains the source code as well as notes for the "Sequence Models" course. This includes jupyter notebooks for jazz improvisation with a Keras LSTM,
